# Personal Website Project Version 1.0
## Version 1.0 April 26, 2023
## Completed Ideas
* Working navbar
* Slideshow intro
* About button.
* About page
* Achievements page
* HTML for education, projects, and contact page
  
## To do
* Navbar modification - less generic, floating at top even when navigating, scroll down on click rather than instant teleportation
* download CV button needs to work
* Add in skills - maybe under achievements?
* Add in work experience - maybe under education?
* download JP Beer analysis paper needs to work
* Add in UCSD Kendo Tournament pictures under projects - maybe a small slideshow?
* Discord link, phone link, email link, and CV link need to work - Maybe make a popup with the information for discord, phone, and email.
* Make footer smaller - EG only visible when clicked to open or something like that

## Possible Changes
* Maybe make fonts not change with window size. Need to tweak that
* Background. Invest in textured background designs?
