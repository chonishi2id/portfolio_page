# Personal Website Project Version 1.0
## Version 1.1 May 8, 2023
## Completed Ideas
* Working navbar
* Slideshow intro
* About button.
* About page
* Achievements page
* HTML for education, projects, and contact page
* Download CV buttons work
* download JP Beer analysis works
* Phone and Email contact solution implemented
* Started work on Japanese Language Option
* Super Secret Credits Implemented

## To do:
* Navbar modification - less generic, floating at top even when navigating, scroll down on click rather than instant teleportation
* Add in skills - maybe under achievements?
* Add in work experience - maybe under education?
* Add in UCSD Kendo Tournament pictures under projects - maybe a small slideshow?
* Custom url and maybe change up metadata. Find a site icon?
* Find some replacement images for the slideshow

## Possible Changes
* Maybe make fonts not change with window size. Need to tweak that.
* Background. Invest in textured background designs?
