										<p>For my software engineering course, I was tasked to work with a group of other students to develop a bullet journal web application in a quarter.
											I was appointed to be the leader of a group of eight students and used Agile development techniques in order to complete the project.
											We were a smaller group than the norm, some members had personal emergencies come up that prevented them from working, and I (as well as a few other members) had no experience in web app development at the time so naturally, the instruction staff did not expect us to submit a relatively finished product.
											However, we made many sacrifices, learned web app development on the fly, and ultimately prevailed to release a working version. We all received an A for our work.
											For this project, while I oversaw the overall development of the app, I focused my efforts into developing the front end workings of the app as my team had several members who had experience with backend development.
											I also put in the majority of the work in connecting data entered into the front-end to be stored in the backend so it could be accessed again.</p>

											The program was supposed to be able to perform a Hamming encoding with additional credit given to performing a SECDED decoding as well as pattern matching capabilities, all while under constraints outlined in the documentation.
											We designed the Instruction Set, created an ALU model in Verilog, and had the processor perform the tasks using the appropriate assembly code structured to the Instruction Set. The project performed the first task without issue but the others still had some bugs in it when we submitted it.
											We received a B+ for our efforts.</p>

											invited instructors all over San Diego to judge, and rallied UCSD Kendo Club members to participate, among a giant list of other things to provide an overall successful tournament experience.
											Of course, since this was the first tournament the club had ever organized, there were a few mishaps along the way so we later got together to write up a list of guidelines on what worked and what didn't. To this day, the UCSD Kendo Club hosts this tournament annually
											every fall with each year improving on the last.</p>

					<h1>Achievements</h1>
					<h2>Academic</h2>
					<p>Despite all the extracurricular activities I have commited myself to outside of school, academic excellence has always been my main priority. 
					   I have worked tirelessly to maintain this excellence. Below are the fruits of my labor.
					</p>
					<h2>Provost's Award</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>This is awarded to any students who complete a quarter with a GPA above 3.5</li>
						<li>Awarded: Fall 2019, Winter 2020, Spring 2020, Fall 2020, Winter 2021, Spring 2021</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Martial Arts</h2>
					<p>Traditional Japanese Martial Arts has been, and will continue to be core to my development and identity.
						From getting thrown around on the mats in my childhood, to helping my Sensei teach Aikido in my adolescence,
						all the way to leading the Kendo and Iaido Clubs at UC San Diego, I have always made time to develop as a martial artist and as a person.
						Though the achievements I have gained are nice reminders of my growth, I value far more the discipline, perseverance, and drive I have built from
						consistent and constant practice.

								<ul>
									<li>Expanded the club from just myself to 15 regular members. The club was on the verge of completely disappearing following the COVID pandemic.</li>

						<h2>Speech and Debate</h2>
						<p>For many people including myself, public speaking causes more fear and anxiety than death itself. However, in my personal pursuit to become a stronger person than yesterday, 
							I took it upon myself to conquer that fear and pick up some speaking skills in the process. 
						</p>
						<h2>Close to the Coast Novice Division - 3rd Place</h2>
