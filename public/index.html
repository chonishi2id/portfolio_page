        <h2>Bujo Studio</h2>
        <p>For my software engineering course, I was tasked to work with a group of other students to develop a bullet journal web application in a quarter.
          I was appointed to be the leader of a group of eight students and used Agile development techniques in order to complete the project.
          We were a smaller group than the norm, some members had personal emergencies come up that prevented them from working, and I (as well as a few other members) had no experience in web app development at the time so naturally, the instruction staff did not expect us to submit a relatively finished product.
          However, we made many sacrifices, learned web app development on the fly, and ultimately prevailed to release a working version. We all received an A for our work.
          For this project, while I oversaw the overall development of the app, I focused my efforts into developing the front end workings of the app as my team had several members who had experience with backend development.
          I also put in the majority of the work in connecting data entered into the front-end to be stored in the backend so it could be accessed again.
        </p>

        <h2>3BC Processor</h2>
        <p>For my computer architecture course, I worked with two other students to develop a custom processor that specialized in certain error correction tasks from scratch.
          The program was supposed to be able to perform a Hamming encoding with additional credit given to performing a SECDED decoding as well as pattern matching capabilities, all while under constraints outlined in the documentation.
          We designed the Instruction Set, created an ALU model in Verilog, and had the processor perform the tasks using the appropriate assembly code structured to the Instruction Set. The project performed the first task without issue but the others still had some bugs in it when we submitted it.
          We received a B+ for our efforts.

        <h2>Japanese beer analysis</h2>
        <p>For my Industrial Organization course, I was tasked to conduct an exploration based on a dataset of beer and apply concepts learned in the class to speculate on how competition is present in the industry.
          Since I was living in Japan at the time due to the Coronavirus pandemic, I asked Dr. Emannuel Vespa, the lead instructor if I could use data I collected from my local supermarket to conduct the exploration and see if I can find the same phenomena he described seeing in the American beer market.
          I was given the green light for this project and found that just like the American beer industry, competition is done in advertisement rather than prices, alcohol content, or other types of branding that I observed in my data collection.
          I received an A for my work.

        <h2>First Annual UCSD Kendo Club Tournament</h2>
        <p>As president of the UCSD Kendo Club, my main goal during my term was to secure a strong renewal to the club's vitality following a severe stagnation in membership, functions, and participation from the COVID pandemic.
          Me and my management board that I had appointed agreed that one of the main pillars of achieving this goal was to organize the club's first tournament in its 25 year history. We communicated with UCSD administration to get permission to host the event,
          invited instructors all over San Diego to judge, and rallied UCSD Kendo Club members to participate, among a giant list of other things to provide an overall successful tournament experience.
          Of course, since this was the first tournament the club had ever organized, there were a few mishaps along the way so we later got together to write up a list of guidelines on what worked and what didn't. To this day, the UCSD Kendo Club hosts this tournament annually
          every fall with each year improving on the last. To this day, it is one of the projects I am most proud of contributing to.

        <h1>Achievements</h1>
        <h2>Martial Arts</h2>
        <p>Traditional Japanese Martial Arts has been, and will continue to be core to my development and identity.
          From getting thrown around on the mats in my childhood, to helping my Sensei teach Aikido in my adolescence,
          all the way to leading the Kendo and Iaido Clubs at UC San Diego, I have always made time to develop as a martial artist and as a person.
          Though the achievements I have gained are nice reminders of my growth, I value far more the discipline, perseverance, and drive I have built from
          consistent and constant practice.
